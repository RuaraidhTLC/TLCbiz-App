                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    TLC Business Solutions was born from a simple observation: service businesses are often run by skilled tradespeople and professionals who excel at their craft but struggle with the administrative and operational aspects of running a business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After years of working in various service industries and witnessing firsthand the challenges of managing schedules, staff, invoicing, and customer communications, we recognized that the right technology, properly implemented, could transform these businesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We set out to create a consultancy that bridges the gap between powerful business software and the practical, day-to-day needs of service businesses. Our approach combines deep technical expertise with real-world understanding of service business operations.
